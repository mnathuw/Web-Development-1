					<h1>What is Black Mirror?</h1>
					<p class="p-1">Black Mirror is a mini anthology television series, exclusive premiere on Netflix, about the
						relationship between humans and technology. Received a lot of positive reviews from the experts and also
						being awarded an Emmy Award by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS), Black Mirror will be a
						must-watch movie for technology devotees.</p>
					<p class="p-2">Things make the film so much attracted because of its relevance to modern society. The
						audiences can recognize themselves through the characters in the film. For example, although it does not
						directly mention, anyone easily realizes it relates to Facebook, Instagram or Twitter right after watching
						the episode "Nosedive".</p>

					<h2>In "Nosedive":</h2>
					<p class="p-3">Whenever you go out, in case that you accidentally offend anyone, you can get their 1 point
						which lowers your average grades. If you keep going, you will increasingly be challenging to get acquainted
						with new people or to use public services. This leads to a "virtual living" society when everyone is happy
						or trying to please those who get higher average point than them.
					<p class="p-4">A society where people look at the phone screen rather than communicate with each other to
						judge through the numbers "4.2" or "3.5". It does not look different where we are living: the place where
						someone is ready to do crazy things if they receive their expected likes on Facebook.</p>
