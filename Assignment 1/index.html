        <p>Things make the film so much attracted because of its relevance to modern society. The audiences can
            recognize themselves through the characters in the film. For example, although it does not directly mention,
            anyone easily realizes it relates to Facebook, Instagram or Twitter right after watching the episode
            "Nosedive".</p>

        <h4>"Nosedive" is one of my favorite ones:</h4>
        <h5>In "Nosedive":</h5>
        <p>Whenever you go out, in case that you accidentally offend anyone, you can get their 1 point which lowers your
            average grades. If you keep going, you will increasingly be challenging to get acquainted with new people or
            to use public services. This leads to a "virtual living" society when everyone is happy or trying to please
            those who get higher average point than them. A society where people look at the phone screen rather than
            communicate with each other to judge through the numbers "4.2" or "3.5". It does not look different where we
            are living: the place where someone is ready to do crazy things if they receive their expected likes on
            Facebook.</p>
        <h6>In "Hated in the Nation":</h6>
        <p>Or in the episode "Hated in the Nation", netizens can select their most hated person including the hashtag
            #DeathTo and then that person will be killed mysteriously. You can see some people are thrown stones for
            some aimlessly reasons from online strangers.</p>
